# Data warehouse tech stack with MySQL, DBT, Airflow, and Spark
The purpose of this project is to build a data warehouse tech stack, an ELT pipeline that 
* receives a stream of data from different sensors 
* stores it in a data warehouse,
* make transformations on the raw data using data build tool (dbt) and 
* visualize the transformed data to provide key insights to a business company using redash. Airflow will also be   used to automate the tasks.
